# Knowledge base

The catalog of **what knowledge exists in your organization and exactly where it
lives**, searchable by the agents. It holds pointers and multilingual summaries,
never document bodies: an agent finds the right document here, then reads it
live through the Jira/Confluence tools with the asking user's own credentials.

This is the operator's guide. The design and its requirements are
[`docs/spec/knowledge-base.md`](spec/knowledge-base.md); the module's own
internals are [`kb/README.md`](../kb/README.md).

## What runs

| Service | What it does | Exposed |
|---|---|---|
| `kb-db` | The catalog's own Postgres, separate from LibreChat's `vectordb` | no port |
| `mcp-kb` | `kb_search` / `kb_get` for the agents. Read-only role, no credentials | no port |
| `kb-scheduler` | Syncs on the configured cadences, drains the refresh queue | no port |
| `kb-cli` | One command and exits (`make kb-*`). Connects as the database owner | not running |
| `kb-webhook` | GitLab push events. Opt-in (`--profile webhook`) | loopback only |

`make up` starts the first three and runs `scripts/kb-bootstrap.sh`, which
creates the schema, the least-privilege query role, and `config/kb-sources.yaml`
if it is missing — then prints whatever is still needed.

## Getting it filling

### 1. Credentials

Sync needs a **read-only service account**: it has to see a space in order to
catalog it. This is *not* the per-user credential an agent reads a page with —
that check still happens at the source, as the user.

```bash
# .env
KB_CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL=https://wiki.internal
KB_CONFLUENCE_USERNAME=kb-bot
KB_CONFLUENCE_PASSWORD=...                     # or KB_CONFLUENCE_PAT
KB_JIRA_BASE_URL=https://jira.internal
KB_JIRA_PAT=...
GITLAB_BASE_URL=https://gitlab.internal
GITLAB_TOKEN=...                               # read_api scope is enough

KB_SUMMARIZER_URL=${VLLM_BASE_URL}             # the BASE url, ending in /v1
KB_SUMMARIZER_MODEL=<the model it serves>      # see its GET /v1/models
KB_SUMMARIZER_API_KEY=${VLLM_API_KEY}          # optional -- omit it if there is no key
KB_SUMMARY_LANGUAGES=en,fa                     # what makes cross-language search work
KB_TIMEZONE=Asia/Tehran                        # `at: "03:00"` means 03:00 here
```

Without the summarizer everything still runs — documents are catalogued under
their real titles, just undescribed, and cross-language search will not work.

Then confirm it is actually usable, rather than merely configured:

```bash
make kb-check
```

It reports each dependency separately — the database, the summarizer, the
source configuration — and names the one that is not ready. The summarizer
check asks the endpoint `GET <url>/models`, which is the call every
OpenAI-compatible server answers: it proves the protocol, and reports whether
the model you named is among the ones served. (A vLLM deployment can advertise
an id different from what it serves, so that part is reported, not enforced.)

The URL is the **base**, ending in `/v1`. A pasted `/v1/chat/completions` is
accepted and trimmed; something that is not a URL fails at startup.

### 2. Choose sources

```bash
make kb-sources-discover          # what Confluence, Jira and GitLab actually contain
make kb-sources-discover WRITE=1  # append them to config/kb-sources.yaml, disabled
```

Discovery reports sizes (`412 pages -- Engineering`, `docs/ADRs: 14 files`) so
the decision is "yes, catalog this one" rather than "what exists?". Then edit
`config/kb-sources.yaml`: delete what does not belong, set `enabled: true` on
what does. Re-running discovery later **never rewrites a line you edited** — it
only appends sources it has not seen, which makes it also the answer to "what is
new that the catalog isn't watching?".

Useful knobs, all optional:

```yaml
  - id: confluence-eng
    kind: confluence
    enabled: true
    spaces: [ENG, PRODUCT]
    # A page's labels decide its entry type -- curation happens in Confluence,
    # in the tool the authors already use.
    type_from_labels: { kb-glossary: term, kb-product: product, kb-team: team, spec-draft: spec, spec-approved: spec }
    exclude_labels: [archive, draft]
```

`spec-draft` and `spec-approved` are the product-spec lifecycle labels
([`PRODUCT_FLOW.md`](PRODUCT_FLOW.md)). Map both to `spec`, and don't exclude
either: a draft spec is meant to be found and discussed. Labels also become the
entry's tags, so agents can tell the draft from the approved version. Add the
space your team writes specs in to `spaces`.

### 3. First sync

```bash
make kb-sync SOURCE=confluence-eng DRY_RUN=1   # what it would read; writes nothing
make kb-sync SOURCE=confluence-eng             # for real
make kb-status
```

Once several sources are enabled, sync all of them in one pass instead of
one `SOURCE=` at a time:

```bash
make kb-sync-all           # FORCE=1 to bypass the content-hash gate
```

It reads every `enabled: true` id straight from `config/kb-sources.yaml`
and syncs each in turn, same live per-document progress. `scripts/kb-bootstrap.sh`
(run by `make up`/`make kb-setup`) already calls this once on its own, the
first time everything is configured and the catalog is still empty — this
is for every time after that.

Then leave it alone: `kb-scheduler` takes over.

### 4. Let the agents use it

```bash
make render-config && make restart SERVICE=api   # LibreChat picks up mcp-kb
make agent-import DRY_RUN=1 && make agent-import # tools + instructions onto the agents
```

The front-door agent is instructed to search the catalog **before** answering or
delegating, in the user's language and the other one, to follow each hit's
`fetch` field and read the real document, to say so and ask when the catalog has
nothing, and to name what it used.

### 5. Optionally, share a source's full text

By default an agent reads the real document live, as the user: Confluence pages
and Jira issues through `agent-skills`, with the user's own credentials. GitLab
has no such tool yet, so a GitLab entry stops at its summary -- an agent can say
*which* ADR answers a question, but not quote what it decided.

For a source where that is not good enough, keep its documents' text in the
catalog:

```yaml
  - id: gitlab-platform
    kind: gitlab
    store_raw_content: true          # per source; refused under defaults
    raw_content_max_bytes: 2097152   # optional; defaults.raw_content_max_bytes otherwise (10 MB)
```

**What this shares.** Every user who can reach the knowledge base can then read
that source's documents in full through `kb_get`, **whatever their access in
GitLab** (or Confluence, or Jira). There is no per-user check -- it is the same
all-or-nothing decision the catalog already makes about summaries, made for the
full text. Turn it on only for sources everyone may read.

**What happens.**

- The next sync of the source stores each document's text at the version the
  summary describes, with no extra model calls (`content_stored` in the
  report). Already-catalogued documents fill in on the next full pass
  (`make kb-sync SOURCE=<id>`), or as each one is next seen.
- Search results show `fetch: kb_get` for those documents, so the agents
  already follow it; `kb_get` returns the text in pages of 24,000 characters.
  Sources with a live tool (Confluence, Jira) keep it as their `fetch`.
- Text is never searched: results and their order do not change.
- A document over the cap keeps its first part, marked `truncated` with its
  original size; the agent is told to say so and give the link for the rest.

**Revoking it.** Set `store_raw_content: false` (or delete the line) and sync
the source once, in any mode -- the scheduler's next incremental tick will do.
The report shows `content_purged`; nothing of the source's text remains. A
document deleted at the source loses its text on the next full pass, with the
entry.

**Cost.** Text documents are small: about 2-20 KB per ADR, so a thousand come to
roughly 20 MB before Postgres compresses them. `make kb-status` shows the
documents kept, how many were truncated, their text size and the table's size
on disk under `raw_content`.

## How it stays current

Four mechanisms, each switchable per source in `config/kb-sources.yaml`:

| Mechanism | Default | What it is for |
|---|---|---|
| `incremental` | on, `every: 15m` | The backbone: asks each source only what changed since its checkpoint |
| `lazy_refresh` | on, `stale_after: 24h` | `kb_get` on a stale entry queues it; the scheduler re-reads that one document |
| `full_scrape` | on, `at: "03:00"` | The only pass that detects deletions, moves and missed events |
| `webhook` | off | GitLab push events, for seconds instead of minutes |

Two properties hold everywhere, and are worth knowing before tuning anything:

- **An unchanged document costs nothing.** Content is hashed, so a re-run makes
  no model call and no write. A 15-minute cadence over a quiet wiki is close to
  free.
- **Only a full pass may conclude something is gone.** An incremental run only
  ever sees what changed, so treating its silence as deletion would empty the
  catalog. Deletions are soft — the row stays, with its date.

### The GitLab webhook (optional)

```bash
# .env
KB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<long random string>
```

```bash
docker compose --profile webhook up -d kb-webhook
# GitLab: Settings > Webhooks > URL http://<host>:8323/gitlab, Secret token = the same
```

It validates the secret, queues the changed paths, and returns. The scheduler —
which holds the credentials and the writable role — does the refreshing. So the
worst a forged request can achieve is a re-read of documents you already have.

## Day to day

```bash
make kb-status                     # counts by source and type, overrides, gaps, migrations
make kb-sources                    # what is configured, and which switch each mechanism is on
make kb-sync SOURCE=<id> [MODE=incremental] [DRY_RUN=1]
make kb-sync-all [FORCE=1]         # every enabled source, one at a time
docker compose run --rm kb-cli gaps          # searches that found nothing
docker compose run --rm kb-cli override set --id <entry> --summary 'en=Better text' --note 'why'
docker compose run --rm kb-cli override clear --id <entry>
make logs SERVICE=kb-scheduler
```

**Gaps are the most useful thing here.** Every search that matched nothing is
recorded, so `gaps` is a ranked list of what your organization has not written
down — generated from real questions rather than guesses.

**Overrides** are corrections that survive every later sync. The entry keeps
being regenerated from its source; your text is re-applied on top. `exclude`
retires an entry from search without touching anything upstream.

### Switching syncing off

```bash
# in config/kb-sources.yaml
approved: false
# or, without editing anything -- and this wins over the file
KB_SOURCES_APPROVED=false
```

Per-source `enabled:` is the everyday control; `approved` is the one switch for
an incident. Every command reports which of the two it used.

## Backup and restore

`kb_data` is in `make backup` like every other volume. What is actually
irreplaceable in it is small: the **overrides**, the **gap log** and the **sync
checkpoints**. Entries, the search index and kept document text are derived —
losing them costs one `make kb-sync` per source, not a restore.

Schema changes are migrations in `kb/migrations/`, applied by `make kb-init`
(which `make up` runs). They are append-only: a shipped file is never edited, so
an upgrade is always "apply what is new, skip what is recorded".

## When something looks wrong

| Symptom | Where to look |
|---|---|
| `kb_search` returns nothing | `make kb-status` — is anything catalogued? Then `make kb-sources` — is a source enabled, and is `approved` true? |
| The catalog is not updating | `make logs SERVICE=kb-scheduler`. A failing source is recorded and retried at its next cadence, not every tick |
| `{"error": {"type": "not_approved"}}` | Syncing is switched off; the message says whether it was the file or `KB_SOURCES_APPROVED` |
| `{"error": {"type": "missing_credential"}}` | The named variables are unset — sync needs a service account, not a user's credential |
| `make kb-check` says the summarizer is not ok | The error is in the report, and a 401 with no key sent adds the hint to set `KB_SUMMARIZER_API_KEY` (optional otherwise). "Not an OpenAI /models list" means the URL points at something else — a proxy, a login page |
| A scheduled run fails with "summarizer is not usable" | The scheduler runs the same check as `make kb-check` before any run that summarizes, and refuses rather than catalogue documents undescribed. Fix the endpoint or `KB_SUMMARIZER_MODEL`/`KB_SUMMARIZER_API_KEY` (the error carries the endpoint's own message, e.g. a 403); the next cadence tries again with no action needed |
| Entries exist but have no summaries | `KB_SUMMARIZER_URL`/`KB_SUMMARIZER_MODEL` are unset, or the endpoint was down when they were catalogued. Re-syncing after fixing it fills them in |
| The nightly pass runs at the wrong hour | `KB_TIMEZONE`. `at: "03:00"` is read in that zone; the default is UTC |
| An agent answers without searching | `make agent-import` — the instruction and the two tools live in `agents/*.yaml` |
| `kb_get` returns `content: null` for a source with `store_raw_content: true` | The source has not been fully synced since the flag was turned on (`make kb-sync SOURCE=<id>`), or the document changed since the last sync — text is only served at the version its summary describes. `make kb-sources` shows the effective setting under `raw_content` |

## Why it is shaped this way

Three constraints explain most of the design, and are worth keeping in mind
before changing it:

- **The catalog stores no document text unless a source opts in.** Answers
  come from the live document, read as the user, so source permissions keep
  working and nothing goes stale behind your back. A source marked
  `store_raw_content` trades that for reach (step 5 above): its text is kept,
  versioned with its summary, and readable by everyone.
- **Reading and writing are different privileges.** `mcp-kb` has a read-only
  database role and no source credentials at all; `kb-scheduler` and `kb-cli`
  have both. That is why a stale entry read by an agent is *queued* for refresh
  rather than refreshed on the spot.
- **Nothing a model can call may write.** Both MCP tools are read-only, which is
  also why neither needs a `toolApproval` entry.
