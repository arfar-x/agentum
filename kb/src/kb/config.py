"""Settings, read from the environment once and validated.

Deliberately not in `application/`: reading `os.environ` is I/O, and a use case
that reaches for a variable is a use case that can't be tested without one.
Everything here is resolved at startup and passed inward as arguments.

This is the **only module that reads the process environment** (enforced by
`tests/test_boundaries.py`). Everything else receives a value, or a mapping from
`process_environment()`, as an argument. One settings class per kind of process,
so each states exactly which variables it needs:

- `Settings` -- the query path (`mcp-kb`) and, extended with the sync fields, the
  scheduler and operator CLI.
- `WebhookSettings` -- the push-event receiver.

`sources.yaml` (the per-source configuration, with its own `${VAR}`
interpolation) is loaded by `kb.sources_config`, which takes its environment
from `process_environment()` as well.
