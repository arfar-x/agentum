"""Reconcile one source document against the catalog.

**This is the single funnel.** Incremental sync, nightly reconciliation, the
lazy refresh and the webhook receiver all call this and nothing else, so the
four mechanisms cannot drift into four subtly different definitions of what an
entry should look like (spec, Part 3).

The expensive step -- summarization -- happens only when the document's content
hash has actually changed. A change of classification alone (type or tags)
rewrites the entry without a model call; everything else is a timestamp
update.

For a source that keeps its documents' text (`store_raw_content`, spec §6.10)
the text is written here too, after the entry, on *every* path including the
unchanged one. That is what lets a source switched on after it was catalogued
fill its text on the next pass without a single model call (FR-CNT-04).
