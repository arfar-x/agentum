"""What should run, right now.

Deciding is separated from doing on purpose: a scheduler that mixes "is it time
yet?" into sleeping and HTTP calls can only be tested by waiting, and a
scheduling bug then takes a day to reproduce. This module is a pure function of
the configuration, the last run times and the clock -- every cadence rule below
is provable in milliseconds (FR-SCH-02).

The four mechanisms and why their cadences differ are in the spec, §9. What
matters here: a disabled mechanism produces no job at all (FR-SCH-01), and a
source already running produces none either, however slow that run is
(FR-SCH-05).
