"""Change the source configuration, carefully (FR-CFG-10..12).

Every change takes two steps. A **preview** makes the edit in memory, checks the
result with the very rules the scheduler loads the file with, and says in words
what it would do -- including what an operator would regret not being told. An
**apply** then repeats the edit against the file as it is *now*, and writes it
only if the file still has the fingerprint the preview was made from and the
operator confirmed. Nothing invalid can be written, and a hand edit made in
between is never silently overwritten.
