"""Re-read the entries readers asked about.

The lazy mechanism, completed: `kb_get` records that somebody opened a stale
entry, and this drains that queue. It is the cheapest freshness there is --
nothing happens until a person cares, and then only the one document is read.

Split across two components on purpose. The MCP server holds a read-only
database role and no source credentials, so it *cannot* refresh anything even by
accident; the scheduler holds both and does the work. The queue is the seam.
