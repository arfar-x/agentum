"""Search the catalog.

Takes several query strings, because the agent sends the user's wording and the
same terms in another language: documents are written in more than one, and one
phrasing must be able to reach the other. Each query is searched separately and
the rankings are fused, so a result found by both rises above one found by
either.

Never calls a model and never touches the network: a search is a database query
plus pure functions, and stays working when the model endpoint is down.
