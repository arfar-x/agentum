"""The agent's front door: two read-only MCP tools over HTTP.

Internal-only, with no published port and no authentication of its own -- the
same trust model `mcp-agent-skills` runs under, and for the same reason:
reachability from `api` on the backend network is the access control. Unlike
that server, this one takes **no credentials at all**. The catalog is shared, so
there is nothing per-user for a caller to supply, and nothing a caller could
supply that would change what it sees.

Both tools return a structured error instead of raising. An agent that gets
`{"error": {...}}` can tell the user the catalog is unavailable and carry on;
an exception would fail the whole turn over a search that was only ever meant to
add context.
