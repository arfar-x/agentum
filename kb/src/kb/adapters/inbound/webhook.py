"""GitLab push events: the seconds-fresh mechanism.

A push to a watched repository refreshes only the files in its payload, within
seconds, instead of waiting for the next incremental tick.

This is the one component that accepts an inbound connection, so it is
deliberately the smallest thing in the module:

- **It runs on its own, on a private interface** (NFR-DEP-04), never inside
  `mcp-kb`, which keeps its no-published-port rule.
- **Every request must carry the shared secret.** GitLab sends it as
  `X-Gitlab-Token`; a request without it is rejected before the body is even
  parsed, and the comparison is constant-time.
- **It does no work of its own.** A valid event enqueues the changed paths and
  returns; the scheduler drains that queue with the credentials and the
  writable role. So the worst a forged, authenticated-looking request can do is
  ask for a re-read of documents that already exist.
