"""The service that runs sync so nobody has to remember to.

Its own container, not a thread inside the MCP server: a full scrape of a large
space can run for minutes, and a search must never wait behind one (NFR-DEP-03).
It is also the only component holding both source credentials and a writable
database role.

The thinking is elsewhere. `use_cases/schedule.due()` decides what should run,
as a pure function of the config, the last run times and the clock; this module
sleeps, executes, records, and keeps going. That split is why a cadence rule can
be tested in milliseconds instead of by waiting a day for 03:00.

**A failure here is never fatal.** One source that is down must not stop the
others, and must not stop the scheduler: the error is recorded against the run
and the next cadence is attempted (FR-SCH-03).
