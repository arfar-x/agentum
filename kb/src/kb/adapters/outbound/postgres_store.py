"""`EntryStore` backed by Postgres.

The catalog's own database (NFR-DEP-01), never LibreChat's. Three things here
are worth understanding before changing any of it:

**Matching.** Queries arrive already normalized by `kb.domain.text`, and the
indexed columns were normalized the same way when they were written -- both
sides or neither, or the same word stops matching itself. Scoring is per query
term, weighted by field, using pg_trgm's `word_similarity`, which asks "how well
does this term match some run of words in that text" rather than comparing a
short query against a long summary as wholes.

**Ranking stops here.** This returns one ranked list per query; combining
several queries is the domain's job (`ranking.reciprocal_rank_fusion`), so that
part stays testable without a database and identical if this adapter is ever
replaced.

**`entry_search` is derived.** It holds the entry merged with its override,
rebuilt whenever either changes. That is what makes an override survive every
later sync (FR-OVR-06) without sync knowing overrides exist.
