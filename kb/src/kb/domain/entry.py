"""What a catalog entry is.

An entry describes a document; it never contains one. That is the point of the
design: `location` tells an agent where the real content lives so it can go and
read it, rather than answering from a summary (see
`docs/spec/knowledge-base.md`, Part 2).

Modelled with pydantic so **an invalid entry cannot exist**: every path that
builds one -- a source adapter, a database row, a JSON payload -- goes through
the same validation, and a malformed document is rejected where it is built
rather than discovered later in search results. Pydantic also reports every
problem in one error, so one bad source produces one complete report instead of
one field per sync run.

Localized fields (`title`, `summary`) are plain language-code -> text maps
rather than fixed `en`/`fa` attributes, so a deployment can catalog whatever
languages it writes in without a schema change.
