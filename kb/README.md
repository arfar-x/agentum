# `kb` — the knowledge catalog

A searchable record of **what knowledge exists in the organization and exactly
where it lives**. It stores pointers and multilingual summaries, never document
bodies: an agent searches the catalog, then reads the real document live through
the tools it already has, with the calling user's own credentials.

The specification is [`docs/spec/knowledge-base.md`](../docs/spec/knowledge-base.md)
and it governs this module. Every requirement there has an id; every
implemented one has a test claiming it, and the suite fails if that stops being
true. Change the spec first, then the code.

## Status

| Phase | Contents | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Specification | done |
| 2 | Pure rules: normalization, ids, hashing, ranking, override merging, validation | done |
| 3 | Use cases against in-memory fakes: search, reconcile | done |
| 4 | Storage: `kb-db`, migration, Postgres adapter | done |
| 5 | CLI and MCP server — usable from LibreChat | done |
| 6 | Sources: Confluence, Jira, GitLab, plus discovery | done |
| 7 | Freshness mechanisms, scheduler, webhook receiver | done |
| 8 | Agent tools and instructions | done |
| 9 | Operator documentation and setup automation | done |
| 10 | Admin console: run history, request queue, source editing, manual records | done |

**The catalog fills and refreshes itself.** Configure the sources, review the
file, and `kb-scheduler` does the rest: incremental runs on the cadence you set,
a nightly full pass that catches deletions, a refresh queue drained for the
entries people actually open, and — if you enable it — GitLab push events for
seconds-fresh updates. The agents have the tools and the instruction to use
them before assuming anything.

Two more source kinds — an internal HTTP API and local files — are specified and
deliberately unbuilt. The config shape is settled, so adding one later is an
adapter and a config entry; building either now would mean guessing at a mapping
and then maintaining the guess.

Operators want [`docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`](../docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md): credentials,
choosing sources, the freshness switches, overrides, the gap log, and what to
check when it looks wrong. What follows is for working *on* the module.

## Getting it running

Python 3.12+, no services, no credentials:

```bash
cd kb
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Run everything that needs no services:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Run the whole suite **including the Postgres-backed tests**, against a
throwaway database container that is removed afterwards:

```bash
cd .. && make kb-test          # or: scripts/kb-test.sh -k override -v
```

Those tests skip in a bare `pytest` run. To point them at a database you
already have:

```bash
KB_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db python -m pytest tests/integration
```

Useful variations:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/domain            # the pure rules only
python -m pytest tests/test_spec_coverage.py   # spec <-> tests agreement
python -m pytest -k persian -v           # one behavior, by name
```

The repo root's `make test` still runs only `agent-skills`' suite; `make
kb-test` is this module's.

### The CLI

Once the stack is up and `make kb-init` has run:

```bash
export KB_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://kb:<KB_POSTGRES_PASSWORD>@localhost:5432/agentflow_kb'

python -m kb status                                   # what the catalog contains
python -m kb search --query 'refund retries' --query 'بازپرداخت'
python -m kb get --id confluence-eng:123456
python -m kb override set --id confluence-eng:123456 \
    --summary 'en=A better summary' --note 'the generated one missed the retry cap'
python -m kb override clear --id confluence-eng:123456
python -m kb gaps                                     # what nobody has written down
python -m kb migrate                                  # same as make kb-init
```

`kb-db` publishes no port, so from the host use `docker compose exec kb-db`, or
run the CLI inside the `mcp-kb` container:
`docker compose exec mcp-kb python -m kb status`.

Every command prints one JSON document and exits 0, errors included:

```json
{"error": {"type": "database_unavailable", "message": "connection refused"}}
```

### Filling it

```bash
make kb-sources-discover            # what Confluence and Jira actually contain
make kb-sources-discover WRITE=1    # append them to config/kb-sources.yaml, disabled

# then edit config/kb-sources.yaml: set `enabled: true` on what belongs

make kb-sources                     # what is configured, and what each mechanism is set to
make kb-sync SOURCE=confluence-eng DRY_RUN=1   # what would change; writes nothing
make kb-sync SOURCE=confluence-eng             # full pass: catalogs, and soft-deletes what vanished
make kb-sync SOURCE=confluence-eng MODE=incremental  # only what changed since the checkpoint
make kb-status
```

GitLab repositories are read by **scopes**: a scope is a directory walked
recursively with file patterns, `dir: "."` means the whole repository, and a
scope's `type`/`tags` are inherited by everything beneath it — so `docs/ADRs`
becomes a set of specs without labelling each file. A file's blob SHA is its
version, so an unchanged file costs no model call, and incremental runs compare
commits and read only what changed.

Sync needs a **read-only service account** (`KB_CONFLUENCE_*` / `KB_JIRA_*` in
`.env`, falling back to the stack's existing `CONFLUENCE_*`/`JIRA_*`): it has to
see a space in order to catalog it. That is a different thing from the per-user
credential an agent uses to read a page later — that check still happens at the
source, as the user.

The summarizer (`KB_SUMMARIZER_URL`/`KB_SUMMARIZER_MODEL`, any OpenAI-compatible
endpoint) is what writes each entry's title, summary and keywords in every
language in `KB_SUMMARY_LANGUAGES`. Leave it unset and sync still runs: entries
get their real titles and stay findable, just undescribed.

Two properties hold regardless of source:

- **A second sync over unchanged content makes no model calls and no writes.**
  Re-running is close to free; that is what makes a frequent cadence sane.
- **A full pass soft-deletes what the source no longer lists; an incremental one
  never does.** An incremental feed only yields what changed, so treating
  silence as deletion would empty the catalog.

Two switches, at different grains:

- **`enabled:` per source** is the one that matters. Discovery writes every
  candidate disabled, so a newly found space stays out of the catalog until
  somebody says otherwise.
- **`approved:`** turns *all* syncing off at once, and `KB_SOURCES_APPROVED` in
  the environment overrides the file — the switch to reach for during an
  incident, without editing anything. It defaults to on, and every command
  reports which of the two it used.

### Keeping it fresh

`kb-scheduler` runs with the stack and needs no cron entry: the cadences come
from `config/kb-sources.yaml`, per source.

| Mechanism | Default | What it is for |
|---|---|---|
| incremental | on, every 15m | The backbone. Asks each source only what changed since its checkpoint |
| lazy refresh | on, `stale_after: 24h` | `kb_get` on a stale entry queues it; the scheduler re-reads that one document |
| full scrape | on, nightly 03:00 | The only pass that can detect deletions, moves and missed events |
| webhook | off | GitLab push events, for seconds instead of minutes |

Every run — scheduled, requested from the admin console, or started with
`make kb-sync` — is written to `sync_run` when it starts and finished when it
ends, with its counts, rejected documents and any error, so "was this working
last week?" survives log rotation. The admin console is where it is read;
`make kb-status` reports the catalog, not the run history.

### The admin console

An opt-in web console for the operator (spec §6.11): sync status and reports,
the schedule, triggering syncs, editing `config/kb-sources.yaml`, and manual
records with on-demand summaries.

```bash
# .env: KB_ADMIN_TOKEN and KB_ADMIN_DB_PASSWORD (scripts/generate-secrets.sh makes both)
make kb-init            # creates the kb_admin role
make kb-admin-up        # http://127.0.0.1:8324
```

It is `src/kb/adapters/inbound/admin/` (a Starlette app) plus `frontend/` (React,
Vite, Tailwind). It never writes the catalog — its database role cannot — so
anything that changes entries is a row in `sync_request` that `kb-scheduler`
executes. Working on the front end:

```bash
cd frontend && npm ci
npm run dev        # Vite, proxying nothing: point it at a running kb-admin
npm test           # vitest
npm run build      # typecheck, then dist/ (the image copies it to /opt/kb/web)
```

The webhook is the one inbound port, so it is opt-in and separate:

```bash
# .env: KB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<a long random string>
docker compose --profile webhook up -d kb-webhook
# GitLab: Settings > Webhooks > URL http://<host>:8323/gitlab, same secret token
```

It never does the work itself — it validates the secret, queues the changed
paths, and returns. The scheduler, which holds the credentials and the writable
role, refreshes them.

### The MCP server

`mcp-kb` serves `kb_search` and `kb_get` on `http://mcp-kb:8322/mcp`, internal
to the backend network, with no credentials of its own — the catalog is shared.
It connects to Postgres as `kb_reader`, which can read and append to the gap log
and nothing else.

LibreChat picks it up from `config/librechat.yaml.example`'s `mcpServers.kb`
entry after `make render-config && make restart SERVICE=api`. Attaching the two
tools to agents is phase 8.

### Against the real database, from Python

```python
from kb.adapters.outbound.postgres_store import PostgresEntryStore
from kb.domain.text import normalize

store = PostgresEntryStore.connect("postgresql://kb:...@localhost:5432/agentflow_kb")
store.migrate()                               # idempotent; same thing make kb-init does
store.search(normalize("refund retries"))     # -> ranked entry ids
```

### Try the behavior by hand, with no database

The use cases take their dependencies as arguments, so the in-memory fakes from
the test suite are enough to exercise the real code:

```bash
cd kb && PYTHONPATH=src:. python
```

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from kb.application.ports.knowledge_source import SourceDocument
from kb.application.use_cases.reconcile_document import ReconcileDocument
from kb.application.use_cases.search_catalog import SearchCatalog
from kb.domain.entry import EntryType, Location
from tests.application.fakes import FakeClock, FakeEntryStore, FakeSummarizer

store, summarizer = FakeEntryStore(), FakeSummarizer()
clock = FakeClock(datetime.now(timezone.utc))
reconcile = ReconcileDocument(store, summarizer, clock)

page = SourceDocument(
    source_id="confluence-eng",
    external_id="123456",
    title="Payment reconciliation",
    body="How refund retries are handled: three attempts with backoff.",
    location=Location(kind="confluence", ref={"page_id": "123456"}, url="https://wiki/123456"),
    type=EntryType.DOC,
    version="42",
)

print(reconcile.execute(page))
# entry_id='confluence-eng:123456' action=<Action.CREATED: 'created'> summarized=True
print(reconcile.execute(page))
# entry_id='confluence-eng:123456' action=<Action.UNCHANGED: 'unchanged'> summarized=False
print(len(summarizer.calls))          # 1 -- the second pass called no model

hit = SearchCatalog(store, clock).execute(["refund retries"]).hits[0]
print(hit.entry.title, hit.fetch_hint)
# {'en': 'Payment reconciliation'} {'tool': 'confluence_get_page', 'args': {'page_id': '123456'}}
```

The second `execute` printing `summarized=False` is the property the whole cost
model rests on: re-running sync over unchanged content makes no model calls and
writes nothing.

Dependencies point inward: `adapters → application → domain`. `domain` and
`application` may not import a database driver, HTTP client, MCP framework or
YAML parser — [`tests/test_boundaries.py`](tests/test_boundaries.py) walks the
source and fails if they do. pydantic is allowed inside, because it is
validation rather than I/O, and it is what makes an invalid entry impossible to
construct on any path.

## Working on it

**Adding behavior.** Write the requirement in the spec first (an `FR-…`/`NFR-…`
row with status `planned`), implement it, add a test with a
`# Covers: FR-…` line, then flip the status to `done`. Forgetting either half
fails `tests/test_spec_coverage.py`, which is deliberate: it keeps
"implemented" from drifting into a claim nobody checked.

**Adding a source** (phase 6 onward) means one file in `adapters/outbound/`
implementing `KnowledgeSource`, and one entry in `config/kb-sources.yaml`.
Nothing in `domain/` or `application/` should change; if it does, the port is
wrong.

**Two properties worth protecting**, both already covered by tests:

- An unchanged document costs no model call and no write (`FR-REC-02`).
- An override outlives every later sync of its source (`FR-OVR-06`) — it lives
  in its own table and is re-applied when the searchable row is rebuilt, so sync
  can overwrite an entry freely without knowing overrides exist.
- An entry whose document could never be fetched cannot be constructed
  (`FR-ENT-02`) — "findable but unreadable" is the failure this whole module
  exists to prevent.
