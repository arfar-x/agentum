"""The hexagonal boundary, enforced.

Without a test, "I/O only at the edges" degrades into "mostly at the edges"
within a month: someone imports psycopg in a use case because it's convenient,
and the layer stops being testable without a database. This walks the source
and fails naming the file and the import.
