"""Deployment requirements that live in the module's compose file and env files.

They are checked here because this is the suite that owns the spec they come
from: NFR-DEP-01 is a claim about `kb/compose.yaml`, and a claim nobody
checks is how a "separate database" quietly becomes another database inside
LibreChat's during a refactor.

Text matching rather than a YAML parse, deliberately: `yaml` is not a dependency
of this module, and these assertions are about a handful of specific lines.
