"""The spec is executable: this test is what makes it so.

`docs/SPEC.md` defines every requirement with a stable id and a
status. A test claims one with a `Covers: FR-ENT-02, FR-REC-05` line. This test
fails when:

- a requirement marked *done* has no test claiming it -- "implemented" without
  evidence is a claim, not a fact; or
- a test claims an id the spec does not define -- usually a requirement that was
  renamed or dropped while the test kept its old label.

Both failures are the same underlying problem: the spec and the code disagreeing
about what was built. Catching it here makes that a build failure rather than
something a reader notices six months later.
