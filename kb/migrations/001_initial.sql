-- kb: initial schema.
--
-- Two ideas shape it:
--
-- 1. **The entry's shape is owned by pydantic, not by SQL.** `entry.data` holds
--    the validated entry as JSONB; only the columns something filters, sorts or
--    joins on are promoted out of it. That keeps one schema (the model) instead
--    of two that drift, and a new entry field needs no migration.
-- 2. **`entry_search` is derived and disposable.** It is the entry merged with
--    its override, normalized for matching. Anything in it can be rebuilt from
--    `entry` + `entry_override`, which is why a lost index is a resync rather
--    than a restore (NFR-DEP-06).
