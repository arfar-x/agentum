# Declarative agent management -- wrapper behind `make agent-export` and
# `make agent-import`. The real work is scripts/agent-sync.js, streamed into
# the running `api` container (it needs LibreChat's own models); this
# script only moves files across the container boundary, as a tar stream
# through `docker compose exec` rather than `docker cp`, so Docker never has to
# read a path on this host (a snap-packaged Docker can't see /tmp, and a remote
# DOCKER_HOST can't see any of it).
#
#   scripts/agents.sh export    database -> agents/*.yaml (replaces them)
#   scripts/agents.sh import    agents/*.yaml -> database. Optional, per run:
#                                 DRY_RUN=1         preview, write nothing
#                                 OWNER_EMAIL=...   force that account as owner
#                                 MODEL_PROVIDER=... / MODEL_NAME=...
#                                                   use these for every agent instead
#                                                   of what the files say
#                                 ALLOW_RENAME=1    let a file rename an existing agent
#                               OWNER_EMAIL, MODEL_PROVIDER and MODEL_NAME may also be
#                               set in .env (gitignored), so they apply without editing
#                               a tracked file; a value given on the command line wins.
#                               MODEL_NAME left unset falls back to .env's own
#                               VLLM_DEFAULT_MODEL -- the same single source of truth
#                               config/librechat.yaml is rendered from -- so agents/*.yaml
#                               never needs a hardcoded model id kept in sync by hand.

# AGENTS_DIR (default: agents) is the host-side directory. See
