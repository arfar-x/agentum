# One command to bring the stack up from a filled-in .env to a working
# login: docker compose up, wait for api to actually be healthy, then
# create the admin account via LibreChat's own config/create-user.js if
# no user exists yet.
#
# Idempotent -- safe to rerun. It never creates a second admin account
# and never touches Mongo directly (the LibreChat app user itself is
# created declaratively by mongo-init/init-librechat-user.sh via the
# official mongo image's /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ convention, not by
# this script).
